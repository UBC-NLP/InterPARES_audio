**Executive Summary**  
A UNESCO‑facilitated forum in Tangier brought together the U.S. television delegation headed by **Morris Mitchell (SPEAKER_02)** and the Soviet television delegation led by **Ivan Andreev (SPEAKER_04)**. The meeting, moderated by the UNESCO session chair **(SPEAKER_00)**, focused on establishing a bilateral exchange of television and film material, expanding news‑coverage cooperation, and fostering cultural understanding through media.  
Key discussion points included the breadth of program categories to be exchanged (everyday life, culture, science, children’s content, newsreels), the logistics of sending crews across borders, and the removal of past barriers to Soviet material distribution in the U.S. Both delegations expressed a clear mutual interest in proceeding, agreed to compile preliminary lists of offerings, and committed to coordinating further details through UNESCO.
