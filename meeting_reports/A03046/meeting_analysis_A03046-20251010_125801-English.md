**Executive Summary**

In late‑1940s Paris, UNESCO’s leadership, French officials, and representatives from 44 member states convened to inaugurate the new UNESCO headquarters. The event combined a formal cornerstone‑laying ceremony with a plenary discussion on the legal, financial, architectural, and diplomatic frameworks that will govern the new building. The meeting confirmed France’s generous provision of the site, secured the ground‑lease terms, and set the course for architectural design and construction. Key participants included the UNESCO Director‑General, the President of the Executive Board, the President of the General Conference, French Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Culture, the UNESCO Secretary‑General, a Turkish ambassador, a Russian delegate, and several ceremonial hosts and translators. The outcome was a mutual commitment to build a symbol of international cooperation that reflects UNESCO’s mission of peace, culture, science, and education.
