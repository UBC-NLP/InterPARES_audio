**Executive Summary**  
The meeting was an international award ceremony celebrating the Kalinga Prize for Science Communication, an award originally conceived by the Indian industrialist Mr. Patnaik and administered by an international committee.  The ceremony took place in India and drew a multilingual audience, including ambassadors, committee members, scientists, and cultural delegates.  The main purpose was to present the award to its seventh laureate, Professor Van Frisch, a German entomologist renowned for his pioneering work on bee communication.  Key discussion points included the universal nature of science, the importance of popularising scientific knowledge, and the cross‑cultural significance of the prize.  Major outcomes were the formal announcement of the laureate, the presentation of the award, and a series of commitments to continue science communication efforts worldwide.
