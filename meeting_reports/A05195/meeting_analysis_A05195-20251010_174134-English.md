**Executive Summary**  
The recording captures a BBC‑Arabic service interview conducted in English by *John Irving* (SPEAKER_00) with *Mr. Mahmoud Ahmed* (SPEAKER_01), a senior Somali delegate. The session was intended for a telephone transmission to London and covers UNESCO’s support for the Somali Republic, especially in education and oceanographic research. John introduces Mr. Ahmed, asks about his background, the challenges faced by the Somali education system, and UNESCO’s 11th General Conference projects. Mr. Ahmed explains the historical context of Somaliland, outlines pressing educational needs—teacher training, curriculum expansion, and resource constraints—and highlights the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean to Somalia. Both speakers express a shared view that UNESCO’s programmes are increasingly visible and useful to Somali authorities, though coordination and funding allocation remain key concerns.
