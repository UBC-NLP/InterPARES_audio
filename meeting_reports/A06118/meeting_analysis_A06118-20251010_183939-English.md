4. **Multilingual Context** – the conversation showcased the multilingual reality of Somalia, influencing how UNESCO’s initiatives might be tailored.  

**Decisions Made**

- No formal policy decisions were reached; the meeting functioned primarily as a knowledge‑exchange and stakeholder alignment exercise.  
- Mr Ali expressed a willingness to engage further with UNESCO on teacher‑training and resource‑allocation projects.  

**Action Items**

1. **UNESCO Coordination Team** – compile a list of Mr Ali’s priority needs (teacher training, learning materials, infrastructure support).  
2. **Follow‑Up Briefing** – schedule a dedicated workshop with the Somali Ministry of Education to outline potential UNESCO programs.

**Key Insights**

1. **Teacher Training is Critical** – Mr Ali underscored that without adequately trained educators, any infrastructure or curriculum improvements will have limited impact.  
2. **Context‑Specific Solutions Matter** – The multilingual, culturally diverse environment in Somalia demands UNESCO interventions that are tailored to local realities rather than one‑size‑fits‑all approaches.  
3. **Conference Outcomes as a Lever** – The 12th General Conference offers a strategic framework that can be leveraged to secure funding and policy support for Somalia’s education reforms.  
4. **Gender Disparities Persist** – Despite overall progress, girls’ access to education remains uneven, necessitating targeted gender‑inclusive programs.  
5. **Data Gaps Limit Planning** – There is a need for reliable, up‑to‑date data on school enrollment, teacher distribution, and infrastructure status to guide effective program design.
