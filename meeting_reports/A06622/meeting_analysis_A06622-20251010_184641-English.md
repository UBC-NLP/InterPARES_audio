**InterPARES‑Audio Meeting Analysis Report**

---

### 1. Executive Summary  
The meeting was a briefing on UNESCO’s “Nubia” campaign, specifically the large‑scale relocation of the Abu Simbel temples threatened by the Aswan High Dam. The discussion was led by two UNESCO staff members: a Danish‑speaking coordinator (SPEAKER_00) and Mr. Rex Keating, Director of Information Services (SPEAKER_01).  

Key points:
- **UNESCO’s role**: The Information Services department is responsible for disseminating campaign details and securing international support.
- **Campaign overview**: Since 1960, UNESCO has coordinated 30‑plus expeditions from 24 countries, successfully relocating 20+ temples and 20‑plus shrines.
- **Abu Simbel operation**: A Swedish‑designed engineering plan will disassemble the temples stone‑by‑stone, move them to a higher elevation, and re‑erect them by 1969. Funding of ~$36 M (19 M pledged, 11.5 M from the UAR) was secured from 47 countries.
- **Future actions**: Rex will visit the Abu Simbel site in early 2025 to monitor progress and report on the operation’s status.

No formal decisions were made; the meeting served mainly to inform and coordinate ongoing efforts.
