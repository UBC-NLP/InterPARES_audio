**Executive Summary**  
The conference convened a multinational team of space‑flight scientists, human‑factors experts, and UNESCO officials to discuss the upcoming Soviet “Восток” mission, its biological and psychological research agenda, and the organization of a June 1965 UNESCO symposium on “Man in Space.”  Press accreditation was finalized through UNESCO, enabling official media coverage.  Key scientific priorities—gravity‑related biology, crew psychosocial dynamics, closed ecological life‑support, and radiation protection—were reaffirmed, and a comprehensive action plan was drafted to integrate these disciplines into future long‑duration missions.  The meeting concluded with a commitment to publish the final volume of the four‑volume space‑biology series, secure funding for the symposium, and establish interdisciplinary working groups to advance human spaceflight readiness.

## Key Insights  

1. **Interdisciplinary Integration is Critical** – Psychological, biological, and engineering challenges are tightly coupled; solutions must emerge from coordinated teams.  
2. **Crew Social Dynamics Drive Mission Success** – Effective inter‑subjectivity and conflict resolution protocols are as essential as hardware design for long‑duration missions.  
3. **Closed‑Loop Life‑Support is a Mission‑Defining Requirement** – Sustainable ecological cycles underpin any endeavor beyond a few months in space.  
4. **Radiation Risk Demands Proactive Mitigation** – Shielding strategies and real‑time monitoring are indispensable for crew safety.  
5. **Multilingual Collaboration Enhances Global Participation** – The use of Russian, French, English, and other languages, supported by real‑time translation, ensures inclusive scientific dialogue and broad media outreach.
