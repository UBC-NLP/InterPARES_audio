**Executive Summary**  
A televised panel and interview series focused on the career of Professor Viktor Abramovich Kovda, a prominent soil‑science scholar and former UNESCO Director of the Natural Sciences Department. The program also served as a platform to review UNESCO’s three‑pillar scientific strategy, the USSR’s legacy in international scientific cooperation, and to outline Prof Kovda’s future research plans. Participants included the Soviet‑TV interviewer (SPEAKER 03), Prof Kovda (SPEAKER 02), a bilingual MBC news anchor, Kim Sung‑hyun (SPEAKER 01), and a French‑speaking commentator (SPEAKER 00). No binding decisions were taken, but several action items and informal agreements were highlighted, particularly the continuation of UNESCO’s collaboration with national academies and the promotion of Prof Kovda’s forthcoming book on soils.

### Main Topics Discussed  

1. **Biography and Achievements of Prof Kovda**  
   - 300+ scientific papers, two‑volume monograph, honorary doctorate from Ghent, Order of the Red Banner of Labour, membership in the World Academy of Sciences.  

2. **UNESCO’s Scientific Strategy**  
   - Three core pillars:  
     a) International cooperation (oceanography, seismology, desertification)  
     b) Development of science infrastructure in emerging nations  
     c) Addressing global challenges (peace, anti‑colonialism, science‑policy)  

3. **UNESCO‑National Academy Partnerships**  
   - Collaboration with USSR Academy, Royal Society, American Academy, CNRS, and the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  

4. **Soviet Legacy in International Science**  
   - Use of USSR’s natural‑resource research for global development programs; emphasis on equality between large and small nations.  

5. **Future Research and Outreach**  
   - Prof Kovda’s focus on desert and arid‑land soil science, planned publication of “Teaching about the soils of the world,” and televised lecture series at Moscow University.  

6. **Budgetary and Political Constraints**  
   - UNESCO’s effectiveness limited by finances, staffing, and occasional political interference.

### Decisions Made  

- **UNESCO will maintain and deepen its collaboration with national academies and scientific unions** to address member‑state calls for more output.  
- **Ongoing support for developing‑country science infrastructure** (national institutes, training programs) will continue.  
- **Soviet experience in anti‑colonial science policy** will be integrated into UNESCO’s future policy documents.  

No formal resolutions or binding agreements were enacted during the televised segments.

### Action Items  

1. **UNESCO Science Department (Viktor Abramovich)** – Strengthen communication and joint programs with national science organizations (e.g., USSR Academy, Royal Society).  
2. **UNESCO Program Office** – Expand the UNESCO Scientific Expedition Network across oceans, seismology, and deserts.  
3. **UNESCO Secretariat** – Allocate additional budget for science‑research and training in developing countries.  
4. **UNESCO Policy Unit** – Review and codify Soviet post‑colonial experience into policy frameworks.  
5. **Prof Viktor Abramovich (SPEAKER 02)** – Initiate lecture series at Moscow University in February; publish and promote the forthcoming monograph on world soils.  
6. **Interviewers (SPEAKER 03 & Kim Sung‑hyun)** – Schedule and conduct a televised interview of Prof Kovda for Soviet audiences (target: within the current media cycle).

### Key Insights  

1. **Prof Kovda’s dual legacy** as a leading soil scientist and a UNESCO administrator showcases the deep intertwining of Soviet scientific excellence with global cooperation.  
2. **UNESCO’s tripartite agenda**—global collaboration, development support, and addressing universal challenges—remains the framework for its science programs, yet is hampered by resource and political constraints.  
3. **The USSR’s model of leveraging natural resources for development** proved influential in shaping UNESCO’s programs in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, underscoring the value of practical, experience‑based knowledge in international policy.  
4. **Public engagement via television** was identified as a key strategy for disseminating scientific insights, reflecting an early recognition of media’s role in science communication.  
5. **The need for continued investment and stronger institutional partnerships** is evident, as member states and internal reviews repeatedly call for expanded outputs and clearer policy integration.
