**Executive Summary**  
The virtual UNESCO session focused on launching a new *World Literacy Programme* that prioritizes **functional literacy** linked to economic development. The discussion moved from a broad, “spread‑the‑butter” mass‑campaign model to an intensive, pilot‑first strategy in five voluntary countries (Algeria, Ecuador, Iran, Pakistan, and Tanzania). The panel emphasized national ownership of language choices, the role of the UN Special Fund as a *facilitative* financial instrument, and the need for sector‑specific integration (agriculture, health, industry). Key decisions included the approval of a first‑wave budget of approximately US $53 k, the commitment to a two‑year special fund request, and the agreement to convene an Accra conference (5‑10 April) to discuss media‑based literacy outreach. The session concluded with a consolidated action plan that assigns clear responsibilities to UNESCO staff, national delegates, and partner experts.

### Key Insights  

1. **Evidence‑driven scale‑up** – expansion will rely on measurable productivity gains linked to literacy.  
2. **Layered funding is essential** – special, emergency, and regular budgets must be coordinated to avoid delays.  
3. **National mobilisation is critical** – UNESCO can only provide frameworks; lasting impact requires local governments to mobilise resources.  
4. **Script pluralism is a barrier** – multiple scripts in Africa hamper literacy; standardisation efforts remain a priority.  
5. **Media‑based outreach under‑utilised** – radio and newspapers can close the gap for semi‑literates; a dedicated market for literacy‑focused content offers new opportunities.  
6. **Work‑oriented, short‑mission deployments** – deploying experts in pairs for 1‑2 week missions allows rapid testing of new models.  
7. **Accra conference is a turning point** – will serve as a forum for cross‑country learning, policy alignment, and launchpad for new media initiatives.
