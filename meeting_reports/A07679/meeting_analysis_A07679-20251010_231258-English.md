**Executive Summary**  
A multi‑day, multilingual workshop was convened under the auspices of UNESCO’s Office of Public Information (OPI) and the Visual Information Board (VIB) to explore the role of television as a development communication tool in developing countries. The meeting brought together senior UNESCO officers, representatives from the Bureau de l’information visuelle (BIV), the United Nations Information Service (UNIS), and national broadcasters. Key objectives were to:  

1. Clarify the purpose of the VIB workshop and secure consensus on its themes.  
2. Identify practical, ready‑made content packages that UN agencies can hand to national TV networks.  
3. Discuss co‑production and funding models that enable national broadcasters to create and disseminate development programmes.  
4. Strengthen cooperation between the BIV, UNIS, and national information services.  

Although no binding resolutions were adopted, the delegates reached informal agreements on the need for a unified media strategy, the creation of a “ready‑made” development package, and continued exploration of co‑production opportunities.

### Key Insights  

1. **Television remains the most effective medium** for reaching broad audiences in developing countries; its impact hinges on locally relevant, well‑produced content.  
2. **UN agencies must deliver packaged, ready‑to‑broadcast material** rather than abstract guidance to gain the trust and adoption of national broadcasters.  
3. **Co‑production models** offer a cost‑effective way for national networks to create development programmes while leveraging UN expertise and resources.  
4. **Transparency and collaboration** between the BIV, UNIS, and national information services are essential for ensuring that UN messaging reaches citizens without appearing top‑down or politically biased.  
5. **Future media platforms (satellite, internet, mobile)** present new opportunities—and challenges—that UNIS and BIV need to anticipate to remain effective in a rapidly changing communication landscape.
