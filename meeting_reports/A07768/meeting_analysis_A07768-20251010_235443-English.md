**Final Report – UNESCO–Iraq Collaboration & Regional Literacy Initiative**

---

## 1. Executive Summary  
A series of multilingual sessions involving UNESCO officials and Iraqi government representatives were held to review and strengthen the partnership between UNESCO and Iraq, and to lay the groundwork for a pan‑Arab literacy programme. The meetings covered UNESCO’s mandate, the importance of integrated development, science and technology capacity building, cultural heritage preservation, and a new Arab‑regional Fund for Literacy. Key participants were the UNESCO Director General René Mahaut (introduced by a moderator), senior UNESCO programme officers, Iraqi ministers of culture and education, and regional liaison officers. No binding agreements were signed, but verbal commitments were made to proceed with a Tripoli conference, launch a regional literacy fund, and roll out technical‑education projects.
