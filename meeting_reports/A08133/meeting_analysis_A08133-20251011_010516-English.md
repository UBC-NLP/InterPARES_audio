**Executive Summary**  
The series of round‑table sessions focused on preparing concise, high‑impact documents for the upcoming UNESCO General Conference, with a particular emphasis on education as a core pillar of peace and development. A Chair (SPEAKER_02) steered the meetings, a Secretariat/Bureau team (SPEAKER_04) coordinated logistics and document drafting, and a group of national delegates (notably SPEAKER_05) contributed substantive content. The Executive Council (SPEAKER_03) approved the circulation of a short declaration, while the Bureau secretary (SPEAKER_00) managed administrative details. The discussions culminated in the agreement to produce a 500‑word declaration for the General Conference, to be presented Friday afternoon, and a separate supporting document due the next day. A joint UN‑organ meeting was also planned to further operationalise the Bellagio paper’s recommendations.

**Key Insights**

1. **Education as the Central Pillar** – Every participant repeatedly highlighted education as the most fundamental human right and a lever for peace, guiding the content of the declaration and funding discussions.  
2. **Urgency and Tight Scheduling** – The agenda was compressed, with multiple documents required within a 48‑hour window, underscoring the need for efficient coordination across the Secretariat and national delegates.  
3. **Clear Delineation of Authority** – The Round Table asserted its sovereign right to issue the declaration independently of the Bellagio group, while the Executive Council positioned its role as informational only.  
4. **Multilingual Collaboration** – Speakers leveraged several languages (English, Welsh, Arabic, French, Turkish, Italian), yet English remained the operational lingua franca, indicating a truly global assembly.  
5. **Strategic Cross‑Organ Coordination** – The plan to convene all UN bodies and NGOs reflects an understanding that the Bellagio paper’s recommendations cannot be executed by UNESCO alone; inter‑agency collaboration is essential.
