**1. Executive Summary**  
The UNESCO‑OAU Education Conference convened in Nairobi in 1971 to evaluate the first “Addis Ababa Plan” for African education and to chart a realistic agenda for the coming decade.  
The meeting was chaired by **Vice‑President John Mwangi** (SPEAKER 01), who welcomed the dignitaries and framed the conference as a national priority.  
**Dr. Keanu Mwangi** (SPEAKER 02), the Kenyan Minister of Education, presented Kenya’s progress—highlighting a 33 % rise in primary enrollment, a quadrupling of secondary schools, and a 7 % allocation of national income to education.  
**Dr. Maria Ndugu** (SPEAKER 00), UNESCO’s Director‑General, underscored the importance of teacher training, curriculum Africanisation, and the creation of a continental revolving fund.  
**Dr. Kofi O. Adjei** (SPEAKER 03), senior OAU/UNESCO representative, emphasized the partnership’s legal framework, the need for secondary and vocational expansion, and the establishment of “centres of excellence.”  

Key outcomes:  
- Confirmation of UNESCO’s role as the conceptual coordinator for African education.  
- Agreement to form national educational planning groups and to integrate education into all sectoral development plans.  
- Launch of a continental revolving fund to finance teacher training and infrastructure.  
- Commitment to expand secondary, vocational, and higher‑education capacities and to introduce “sandwich” teacher‑training schemes.

**6. Key Insights**

1. **Education as the Core of Economic Growth** – both Kenyan officials and UNESCO leadership emphasize that investment in schooling directly fuels national development.  
2. **Kenya as a Benchmark** – enrollment statistics and a 7 % GNI allocation showcase what targeted policy can achieve, providing a model for other nations.  
3. **Funding Gap Persists** – the recurring 7 % figure reveals many African states still under‑allocate to education compared with global averages.  
4. **Teacher Supply is Critical** – the proposed “sandwich” programme and revolving fund target teacher shortages, a primary bottleneck for quality improvement.  
5. **Curriculum Africanisation is Essential** – embedding local culture and context into curricula is seen as a strategic move to reduce colonial legacies and improve relevance.  
6. **Sustainable, Self‑Reliant Mechanisms** – revolving funds, regional offices, and centres of excellence are viewed as mechanisms for long‑term, locally owned progress.  
7. **Gender Equity as a Development Imperative** – girls’ enrollment remains a priority, with policies aimed at closing the gender gap and reducing dropout rates.  

**7. Next Steps**

- UNESCO to finalize the 5‑year action framework and coordinate the Paris conference.  
- OAU to continue supporting the initiative, engaging member states in revising targets, and facilitating knowledge sharing.  
- African Ministries of Education to review national budgets, align enrolment targets, implement teacher‑training reforms, and establish monitoring mechanisms.  
- Donor and multilateral agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, etc.) to align financial and technical support with the revised priorities, especially for primary infrastructure and science education.
